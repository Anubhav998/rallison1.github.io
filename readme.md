What is content strategy?
Content strategy has been described as planning for "the creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content."[2] It has also been called "a repeatable system that defines the entire editorial content development process for a website development project."

In a 2007 article titled "Content Strategy: The Philosophy of Data," Rachel Lovinger describes the goal of content strategy as using "words and data to create unambiguous content that supports meaningful, interactive experiences." Here, she also provided the analogy that "content strategy is to copywriting as information architecture is to design."

The Content Strategy Alliance combines Kevin Nichols' definition[5] with Kristina Halvorson's and defines content strategy as "getting the right content to the right user at the right time through strategic planning of content creation, delivery, and governance."

Erin Kissane makes the claim that anything online that "conveys meaningful information" is content. Therefore, anytime someone posts information online, regardless of size or function, they are partaking in content strategy.

With evergreen content frequently used in content strategies, Mark Fleming argues that the process of a content strategy is not a linear path with a distinct beginning and an end, but rather an ongoing lifecycle. As so, strategic initiatives go through three distinct stages of goal setting, content creation, and analysis before restarting the content marketing lifecycle again.
